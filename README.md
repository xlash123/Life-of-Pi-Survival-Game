# Life-of-Pi-Survival-Game
A survival game that is based upon the novel "Life of Pi". This is a project for my AP Literature class.
Right now, it's in the VERY early stages of development, but in 2 weeks (April 19th) it will be finished.
If i like it enough, I'll even do some updates to make it better, more fun, or less buggy.
I'm working on this project on my own as of now, but I plan to get help from my friends, specifically for design.
The game will be in the pixelated style and will take inspiration from various games like that, such as Minecraft and Starbound.
